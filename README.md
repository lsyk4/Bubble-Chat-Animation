# Bubble-Chat-Animation
This is a bubble chat animation based on less and jquery.
This less is compiled with gulp (you need to use node.js).
If you want, you can only use the following files:
 Markup : * dist/css/main.min.css
          * src/js/chatbubbles.js

You can also search for a less online compiler and compile 
Markup : `src/less/chatbubbles.less`

Tell me if you have any suggestion.
