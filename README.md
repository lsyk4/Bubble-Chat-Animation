# Bubble-Chat-Animation
This is a bubble chat animation based on less and jquery.
This less is compiled with gulp (you need to use node.js), also uses bower and npm.
If you want, you can only use the following files:
* dist/css/main.min.css
* src/js/chatbubbles.js

You can also search for a less online compiler and compile 
`src/less/chatbubbles.less`

Tell me if you have any suggestion.
